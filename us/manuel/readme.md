Let me introduce myself.

I've been working as a DevOps engineer / Systems engineer / Jack of all trades (*master of none!*) since October, 2000.

My background is that of a classical systems administrator who understands Internet services and ISP daily life. I've been working for some of them, or working at some of them for more than half of my professional career.

I'm also able to type some meaningful code, either in PHP, Perl or various scripting languages.

Nowadays I can manage myself reasonably well with the unstoppable amount of new cloud-related things that are flooding our work hours.

Don't hesitate to ask about anything infrastructure or cloud-related. I'll be glad to try to shred some light.
