After the well known [Gitlab disaster / outage / disclosure](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/), that could have been followed even in a live stream, some people think that they can extract certain conclusions.

The way they handled the incident can be seen a bit blurry or inadequate, to say the least. Anyway, nobody can say they're not transparent.

Anyway, following this incident and the sea of news that came after, somebody kindly gave me this link with some interesting knowledge: [Gitlab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
