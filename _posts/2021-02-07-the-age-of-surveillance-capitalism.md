Browsing through YouTube, I came across this interesting Dutch documentary from VPRO channel about information, power, social networks and the implications of any combination of them.

Here, Shoshana Zuboff alerts us about the implications of giving away our personal information.

Here's the [documentary's web page](https://www.vpro.nl/programmas/tegenlicht/kijk/afleveringen/2019-2020/de-grote-dataroof.html) and you can find [her book](https://www.amazon.es/Surveillance-Capitalism-Fight-Future-Frontier/dp/1781256853) in Amazon.
