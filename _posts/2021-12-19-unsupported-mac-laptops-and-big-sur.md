Another side effect of using modern macOS versions on unsupported Mac laptop is that you end up missing some features.

In this particular case, the function keys that allows you to turn on and off the keyboard lights are no longer working.

Thanks to [LabTick](http://labtick.proculo.de/) you'll have access to that feature again. One icon in the top bar will allow you to enable the lights and control the keyboard backlight intensity level.
