During my current interest about Azure cloud services, I've spotted [this link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mssmallbiz/2017/07/11/largest-free-microsoft-ebook-giveaway-im-giving-away-millions-of-free-microsoft-ebooks-again-including-windows-10-office-365-office-2016-power-bi-azure-windows-8-1-office-2013-sharepo/) with tons of free available ebooks about some interesting subjects.

**Note!** As of 2021-02-10, the link is no longer available. However, there is [a backup copy at archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170724153031/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mssmallbiz/2017/07/11/largest-free-microsoft-ebook-giveaway-im-giving-away-millions-of-free-microsoft-ebooks-again-including-windows-10-office-365-office-2016-power-bi-azure-windows-8-1-office-2013-sharepo/).
