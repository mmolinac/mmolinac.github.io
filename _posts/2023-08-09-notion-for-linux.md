I noticed the Notion application thanks to a [colleague](https://javiervidal.net/). It's a productivity and note-taking web application that also has versions for Mac, Windows and (somehow), Linux.

First, I started my test of the application by taking some notes from the web version. Later on, I downloaded the Mac version to be able to take notes offline. It's one of the main features of the application that I like.

However, I missed the app being 100% multiplatform, so I checked and I found [Steve Rydz](https://steverydz.com/)'s [repo](https://github.com/steverydz/notion-snap).

I've been using that one Snap version since then.

However, as it's no longer maintained, I found a new GitHub repository called [notion-snap-reborn](https://github.com/Pietrucci-Blacher/notion-snap-reborn) with a version that I've tested.

Enjoy!
