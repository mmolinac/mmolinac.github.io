I've been reading part of this article and I totally agree with what I've read.

[After years of intensive analysis, Google discovers the key to good teamwork is being nice](http://qz.com/625870/after-years-of-intensive-analysis-google-discovers-the-key-to-good-teamwork-is-being-nice/)

I really think that there's no special treatment or benefit you can grant to your team / coworkers / employees that guarantee success.

BUT, if you really listen, if you really behave with them, and take their suggestions and ideas into account, it will be enough.
